# Goemon64Recomp-Android — working context for Claude Code

Unofficial Android port of klorfmorf's Goemon64Recomp (N64 static recompilation,
Zelda64Recomp/N64Recomp ecosystem). GitHub: `ogdanimal/Goemon64Recomp-Android`
(**PUBLIC** since 2026-07-20). Default branch `main`, work branch `dev`. Remotes:
`origin`=ogdanimal, `upstream`=klorfmorf.

## Environment
- Repo lives in WSL at `~/projects/Goemon64Recomp`; work as a normal (non-root) user
  (no sudo/root needed — the repo was relocated out of `/root` on 2026-07-17).
- `gh` is authed as `ogdanimal`; git commit identity is
  `ogdanimal <306057786+ogdanimal@users.noreply.github.com>` (GitHub noreply, set
  2026-07-20; the old `the.ogdanimal@gmail.com` remains on earlier commits and is
  fine to stay public).
- **`gh` defaults to `upstream` (klorfmorf) unless told otherwise** — with no
  default set it prefers the remote named `upstream` over `origin`, so bare
  `gh run list` silently returns klorfmorf's public workflow runs (they even have
  a `dev` branch, so the output looks plausible — it just isn't ours). Fixed in
  this clone via `gh repo set-default ogdanimal/Goemon64Recomp-Android`, which
  writes `remote.origin.gh-resolved = base` into `.git/config`. **That is local
  to the clone and will NOT survive a fresh clone — re-run it after cloning**,
  or pass `--repo ogdanimal/Goemon64Recomp-Android` explicitly.
- ROM `mnsg.z64` (32 MiB, gitignored) sits at the repo root — the decompressed US ROM
  the recompiler consumes. Never commit it.
- **Back up on-device data BEFORE installing anything that changes storage paths,
  and before any uninstall / `pm clear`.** Verify the backup by CHECKSUM, not by
  `adb pull`'s success message. Latest: `%USERPROFILE%\goemon-backups\2026-07-19\data`
  (93 files, 43 MB — saves, configs, ROM, assets). Saves live in
  `<dataDir>/saves/mnsg.us.bin` plus `.bak` and `.manual.bak`.
  NOTE: `mnsg.us.z64` in the data dir is written by the native runtime when it
  registers the ROM — it is NOT a stale duplicate of `mnsg.z64`, do not "clean it up".
  Latest verified full backup: `%USERPROFILE%\goemon-backups\2026-07-23-rp5-preuninstall\data`
  (92 files, 43 MB, every file checksum-matched to the device before uninstalling).
- **THE RP5 RUNS A RELEASE-SIGNED BUILD, so a local debug APK cannot replace
  it.** `install -r` gives `INSTALL_FAILED_VERSION_DOWNGRADE` (debug is
  versionCode 1); `install -r -d` then gives `INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE`
  (different signing key). The only local route is uninstall + install, and
  **uninstall EMPTIES `saves/`**. Observed 2026-07-23: after uninstall +
  reinstall, `assets/`, `mnsg.z64` and `mnsg.us.z64` were all present again with
  correct checksums but `saves/` was **empty** — the mechanism is NOT
  established, so do not rely on any of it surviving. Back up and restore saves
  by hand and re-verify by checksum. To avoid the wipe entirely, use a
  release-signed APK instead (a `vX.Y.Z-rc*` tag builds one in CI — note the
  release workflow rejects tags not descended from `main`). The RP5 now carries
  the **debug** build of the dualSrcBlend fix, so reinstalling any signed
  release will need another uninstall + restore.

## Build reality (important)
- A clean `--recurse-submodules` clone canNOT build without the ROM: `RecompiledFuncs/`
  and `RecompiledPatches/` are generated (not committed) by running `N64Recomp mnsg.toml`
  and `RSPRecomp aspMain.toml` against `mnsg.z64`. The ROM is a BUILD-time input; its
  data never ships in the APK (APK `assets/` = only the mod's fonts/RmlUi UI).
- Submodule fork chain (all on branch `goemon-android`, remote `fork`=ogdanimal):
  `lib/rt64`→ogdanimal/rt64, `lib/N64ModernRuntime`→ogdanimal/N64ModernRuntime,
  and nested `lib/rt64/src/contrib/plume`→ogdanimal/plume (carries the Android
  `setRenderWindow`/ANativeWindow surface fix). Repo is self-contained for recursive clone.

## CI — DONE & GREEN
`.github/workflows/android.yml` builds the arm64-v8a **debug** APK on GitHub-hosted
runners on every push to `dev`/`main`. It pulls the ROM from the PRIVATE companion repo
`ogdanimal/Goemon64RecompSecrets` via the secret `G64RS_REPO_WITH_PAT` (an authenticated
clone URL), runs the host recompile + host `file_to_c` + patches codegen, then
`gradle assembleDebug`. NDK 27.1.12297006, CMake 3.22.1. Actions pinned to node24 runtimes.
- **DUAL-SOURCE-BLEND GUARD added 2026-07-23** (`.github/scripts/check-dual-src-blend.sh`,
  run early in BOTH workflows): the issue #15 regression tripwire. Requires every
  `SRC1_` blend factor in rt64's own C++ to be selected within a **statement**
  naming `dualSrcBlend`, and every `SV_TARGET1` / `vk::index(1)` in **any** rt64
  shader source (`*.hlsl`/`*.hlsli`, contrib pruned) to
  sit inside `#if !defined(NO_DUAL_SRC_BLEND)`. Unlike the `patches/Makefile`
  guard it **cannot pass vacuously** — it fails if it finds no dual-source sites
  at all, or if the submodule/anchor shader is missing. Every failure mode was
  provoked, not assumed. If a legitimate rt64 upstream merge moves these sites,
  update the script rather than deleting the step.
  **WIDENED 2026-07-24** (review round 2, three confirmed edge cases): the C++
  match is statement-scoped so a ternary reformatted across lines no longer fails
  closed; the shader scan is no longer hardcoded to `RasterPS.hlsl`, so a new
  shader declaring a secondary output cannot escape; and the preprocessor walker
  has an `#elif` rule. The `SV_TARGET1` inside `generateShaderText`'s C++ string
  is deliberately out of scope — DXIL/Metal only, covered instead by rt64's
  `shaderFormat == SPIRV || capabilities.dualSrcBlend` assert (reviewer-accepted;
  note the assert compiles out under `NDEBUG`).
  **TIGHTENED AGAIN 2026-07-24 (review round 3) — and this is the lesson:** those
  round-2 widenings each opened a false NEGATIVE. Comments now get stripped
  before either check runs (a `// dualSrcBlend` above a bare `SRC1_` had become
  the gate — a *wider* hole than the line-based check it replaced), and a
  `#if !defined(...)` only counts when the negation applies to
  `NO_DUAL_SRC_BLEND` itself with no `||` (`#if defined(NO_DUAL_SRC_BLEND) &&
  !defined(FOO)` had been passing a secondary output in the *fallback* branch).
  **`.github/scripts/test-dual-src-blend-guard.sh` now pins all 27 cases in both
  directions and runs in both workflows** — because twice in a row a fix for a
  false positive moved a hole instead of closing it, and only external probing
  caught it. Change a regex, run the suite.
- **ROM-fetch step HARDENED 2026-07-22** (`64269bd`, on `dev` AND `main`; mirrors
  sibling Quest64-Recomp `7bd6068`): the secrets clone is `rm -rf`'d the instant the
  ROM is copied out (its `.git/config` holds the PAT — a raw clone has no post-job
  credential scrub the way actions/checkout does), and the ROM is verified with
  `sha1sum -c` against the pinned US-ROM sha1
  `6ea0ed71032ce08fc2745f412d84936382197494`. The hash is pinned in BOTH
  `android.yml` and `android-release.yml` — if the ROM input ever changes, update
  both. To (re)derive it against the copy CI actually clones (not just the local
  file): `gh api -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.raw"
  repos/ogdanimal/Goemon64RecompSecrets/contents/mnsg.z64 | sha1sum` (raw media
  type serves blobs ≤100MB). Local `mnsg.z64` and the secrets-repo copy were
  byte-identical at pin time. Verified LIVE: the first `dev` run's fetch step
  passed with the checksum in place (positive confirmation — a mismatch fails the
  step).
- Grab the latest test APK: `gh run download <run-id> --repo ogdanimal/Goemon64Recomp-Android`
  (or the run's Artifacts). Debug-signed → sideloadable; asks for the user's ROM on first launch.

## Current focus & parked work

**STATUS 2026-07-24: REVIEW COMPLETE — awaiting the maintainer's release go/no-go.**
The issue #15 Mali fix is complete, device-verified on both vendors, CI-green on
`dev`, and **reviewed over three rounds, all applied** (see
`RESUME-mali-review.md`); **the fix itself is unchanged through all three** —
rounds 2 and 3 were doc wording plus CI-guard hardening, nothing in the shader or
blend path. **Round 3 answered both open questions:** the `generateShaderText`
guard exclusion is accepted as made (with the `NDEBUG` assert gap held
knowingly), and **render-equivalence testing is NOT a ship blocker** — it is an
accepted known limitation, provided the limitation is named in the release notes
and the issue #15 reply and the same-frame Mali/Adreno capture happens
post-release. **The reviewer explicitly deferred the release decision itself, so
the maintainer's own go/no-go on cutting `v1.0.3` is still required.**
**Do not trust any `dev` hash written in these docs — read the tip.
`dev` history was REWRITTEN on 2026-07-23 (PII scrub, see the public-repo
section), so every pre-rewrite hash in older notes is a dead commit.** An in-depth
technical rundown was delivered in-session; the durable copy of everything it
covered is the issue #15 bullet below plus
`docs/re-notes/RESUME-mali-review.md`, which is **the resume prompt for this
waiting state — read it first**.

**DO NOT, until the maintainer gives the release go-ahead:** fast-forward `main`,
tag any `v*`, or reply to issue #15. The technical gate is cleared; what remains
is the maintainer's own call on shipping, which the reviewer deliberately did not
make for them.

**NEXT ACTIONS, in order, once the maintainer says ship:**
1. ~~Apply whatever the review asks for~~ **DONE — all three rounds applied.** If
   a fourth arrives, apply it on `dev` through the submodule chain
   (plume → rt64 → root), re-verifying the gitlink chain with `git ls-remote`.
   Re-run the Mali device check for any shader/blend change — and use the
   `ubershadersOnly = true` positive control if the change touches the
   `alphaBlend` agreement (see the follow-up-bug bullet below).
2. **Fast-forward `main` to the `dev` tip** — check the gap with
   `git log --oneline origin/main..origin/dev` rather than trusting a count
   written here, which drifts with every commit. Required before any release: the
   release workflow **rejects a `v*` tag whose commit is not an ancestor of
   `main`**. Also a `promote-public-fixes-to-main` case — the Mali fix is for a
   public bug report and `main` is the public default branch.
3. **Cut `v1.0.3`**, doing a `v1.0.3-rc1` dry-run tag first (proves the
   versionCode derivation → `10003`, monotonic over v1.0.2's `10002`). Release
   notes must be applied AFTER with `gh release edit --notes-file`, emoji-free.
   **The notes MUST name the known limitation in one sentence** — coverage-based
   effects are approximated on GPUs without dual-source blending — which is a
   condition the reviewer attached to shipping without the render-equivalence
   test, not optional polish.
   **Smoke-testing that rc on the RP5 needs an uninstall + save restore**, because
   the RP5 currently holds the *debug* build of the Mali fix and a release-signed
   APK cannot install over it — back up and checksum-verify first, and expect
   `saves/` to be emptied. See the RP5 bullet in § Environment.
4. **Reply to issue #15** — the standing decision is to hold until the fix
   ships, so this is gated on step 3, not on anything technical. **Carry the same
   one-sentence limitation** into the reply.
5. **Post-release validation (the reviewer's other condition):** the same-frame
   Mali/Adreno capture plus effect-heavy gameplay with `RT64_DIAG_CVG_ADD`. It is
   wanted for any upstream PR regardless, and it is the triage path if a Mali
   user reports edge/transparency artifacts.
6. Then: the two open Vulkan-validation findings (see the issue #15 bullet), and
   the still-deferred M8 + N5 device-gated checks.

- **ISSUE #15 — white screen on Mali GPUs. ROOT CAUSE FOUND AND FIXED
  2026-07-23, device-verified on Mali. NOT yet released; issue not yet
  answered.** Reporter `tonysantosl` on a **Retroid Pocket 4 Pro** (Dimensity
  1100, Mali-G77 MC9): game boots, audio fine, graphics all white with most
  textures missing. First non-Adreno report — all our test hardware to date is
  Adreno (RP5 = Adreno 650, AYN Thor).
  **Resume prompt for a fresh session: `docs/re-notes/RESUME-mali-issue15.md`.**
  - **ROOT CAUSE: RT64 implements N64 alpha blending entirely with dual-source
    blending, and no Mali GPU supports the `dualSrcBlend` feature.**
    `rt64_raster_shader.cpp` asked for `SRC1_ALPHA`/`INV_SRC1_ALPHA`
    unconditionally so `SV_TARGET0.a` could carry coverage while the blend
    factor rode in `SV_TARGET1`. plume passes the device's own queried feature
    set to `vkCreateDevice`, so `dualSrcBlend` is enabled iff supported —
    unsupported on Mali, and **the Mali driver still returns `VK_SUCCESS` from
    `vkCreateGraphicsPipelines`** and then blends undefined. Hence "every API
    call succeeds, the output is wrong", with zero errors in any log.
  - **THE FIX (gated, inert on Adreno):** new `RenderDeviceCapabilities::dualSrcBlend`
    (plume `4e77e67`); a `NO_DUAL_SRC_BLEND` variant of `RasterPS.hlsl` that drops
    the secondary output and carries the blend factor in the primary output's
    alpha; runtime selection of that variant plus `SRC_ALPHA`/`INV_SRC_ALPHA`
    (rt64 `3606f0b`). Devices reporting `dualSrcBlend=1` take the byte-identical
    old path. **TRADEOFF, by design: on the fallback path the coverage value the
    primary output would carry is lost wherever the blend factor takes its place,
    so coverage-based effects (N64 AA edges) are approximate.** Sharpened
    2026-07-23: `Copy()` sets `srcBlendAlpha=ONE`/`dstBlendAlpha=ZERO`, so the
    framebuffer alpha receives whatever `SV_TARGET0.a` holds — coverage normally,
    the blend factor on the fallback.
    **SCOPE CORRECTED 2026-07-24 — the two shader paths differ, and the earlier
    wording here (written before the ubershader fix below) understated it.**
    Specialized path: the shader overrides `resultColor.a` only when `alphaBlend`
    is set, so `cvgAdd` WITHOUT `alphaBlend` is genuinely unaffected. Ubershader
    path (`DYNAMIC_RENDER_PARAMS`): the factor is written UNCONDITIONALLY — that
    is exactly what the follow-up fix below does — so **every** uber draw writes
    the factor (`1.0f` when not blending) instead of coverage, `alphaBlend` or
    not. Uber pipelines only cover draws until the specialized pipeline compiles,
    so that loss is normally transient; `ubershadersOnly` makes it permanent.
    Worst case either way is `cvgAdd`, where `dstBlendAlpha=ONE` accumulates that
    alpha: coverage-wrap emulation accumulates the blend factor instead of
    coverage, so it is **broken there, not merely approximate**.
    **The wrong alpha also leaves the GPU:** `Float4ToRGBA16`
    (`lib/rt64/src/shaders/Formats.hlsli:95`) derives the RGBA5551 alpha bit from
    `round(a * 255) % 8`, and `FbWriteColorCS` packs that back into emulated
    RDRAM — so on the fallback the *game* can read a blend factor where coverage
    should be. Whether mnsg reads those bits is UNKNOWN and untested.
    **MEASURED ON DEVICE 2026-07-23** (was previously code-derived only), via the
    `RT64_DIAG_CVG_ADD` counter, intro attract sequence, both vendors: **the worst
    case is REACHABLE** — thousands of `cvgDst=WRAP` draws plus ~100 `CVG_DST_SAVE`
    ones in the intro alone — and **every single one of them also alpha-blends**
    (the non-blending count was zero on both devices), so `cvgAdd && alphaBlend`
    is not a corner case: **in everything measured so far it is the only case.**
    That is one intro attract sequence, not the game — effect-heavy gameplay is
    where a non-blending `cvgAdd` draw would first plausibly show up. Non-zero on
    Adreno too, which confirms the counts come from the game's display lists
    rather than the GPU — that is agreement on the *draw mix*, which was never in
    doubt; whether the fallback *renders* equivalently is still untested. A
    `ubershadersOnly = true` positive control on Mali — coverage lost on EVERY
    draw — still rendered the intro correctly, so the loss is not grossly
    visible; subtle AA-edge differences remain unmeasured and no same-frame
    comparison was made. Full numbers and caveats:
    `docs/re-notes/RESUME-mali-review.md` § "The cvgAdd measurement". If a Mali
    user reports edge/transparency artifacts, this is still the first suspect.
  - **Verified on device** (Galaxy A15, Mali-G57): logs `dualSrcBlend=0`, intro
    and title screen render in full colour, and Vulkan validation reports **0**
    dual-source errors where it previously reported **72** — in a run that still
    reports the other two VUID classes, so the zero is a real result and not a
    dead layer. Also verified at the app's **default** graphics settings
    (`hpfb: Auto`, `Original4x`), not just the settings used while debugging,
    and at **`MSAA4X`** — that last one matters because the fallback ships six
    new SPIR-V variants and the three MS ones would otherwise never have been
    executed by any test (default `msaa_option` is `None`). MSAA4X renders
    correctly with no pipeline failures.
  - **FOLLOW-UP BUG IN THE FIX, found and fixed 2026-07-23 while reviewing it
    (rt64 `3606f0b`):** `RasterShaderUber` hardcodes `PipelineCreation::alphaBlend
    = true` (the `RasterShaderUber` ctor, `rt64_raster_shader.cpp:516` — cite the
    function, line numbers here have already drifted once), so ubershader
    pipelines ALWAYS blend
    while the shader decides per draw. Dual-source tolerates that because
    `resultAlpha` initialises to `1.0f`, making the factor a neutral copy. The
    first cut of the fallback only moved the factor into `resultColor.a` when
    `alphaBlend` was true, so ubershader draws that did NOT alpha-blend were
    composited against **coverage** (~8/255, or 0 under `CVG_DST_SAVE`) — i.e.
    at ~3% opacity or invisible. Fixed by keying on `DYNAMIC_RENDER_PARAMS`
    (exactly the ubershader variant) and always writing the factor there; the
    specialized path keeps the `if (alphaBlend)` guard because it derives
    `alphaBlend` from the same predicate the shader uses. **Proven with a
    provoked positive control:** forcing `ubershadersOnly = true` in a local
    build, the old shader loses the entire opaque title-screen background and
    the fixed shader restores it. **RULE: `PipelineCreation::alphaBlend` and the
    shader's own `alphaBlend` must agree, and they only do on the specialized
    path — changing either side requires changing the other.**
  - **ADRENO REGRESSION CHECK PASSED 2026-07-23 (RP5, Adreno 650):** logs
    **`dualSrcBlend=1`**, so Adreno provably takes the byte-identical old code
    path. Real gameplay off the user's own save renders correctly (textures,
    alpha-blended HUD, shadows, particles). The fix is confirmed inert on
    Adreno, not merely inert by construction.
  - **REFUTED — `hpfb_option` is NOT causal.** An earlier session recorded a
    "confirmed causal A→B→A byte-identical" `hpfb` result. It does **not**
    reproduce: `Off`/`On`/`Auto` all render the launcher correctly, and in-game
    all four combinations of `hpfb` × `res_option` give byte-identical white
    (12,499 B). The old result appears to have compared the RmlUi launcher
    against the RT64 game as if they were one surface. `res_option` is likewise
    eliminated, and the `mali_gralloc` format errors are noise — they appear
    identically in launcher runs that render correctly. Do not re-raise any of
    these without new evidence.
  - **REFUTED — the descriptor-set theory.** The predicted failure of the
    Android-only full-`UpperRange` (8192) `UPDATE_AFTER_BIND` texture-set
    allocation in `rt64_framebuffer_renderer.cpp` does NOT occur: a clean log
    has **no** `vkAllocateDescriptorSets failed`. Do not re-raise without new
    evidence.
  - **Repro device: Galaxy A15 5G** (`SM-A156U1`, MT6835 / Dimensity 6100+,
    **Mali-G57 MC2, driver r38p1**, Android 15, Vulkan 1.3). Reachable **only
    over wireless debugging** — its USB ADB path is broken at the Windows driver
    level and is a dead end, do not retry it. `adb mdns services` discovers both
    the pairing and connect ports; **the port rotates on every reconnect**, so
    always re-derive it. It also enumerates **twice** (IP and mDNS name) as one
    physical device, so pin `adb -s`. Details in memory `mali-repro-device-a15`.
  - **Vulkan validation layers are installed on that device and can be toggled
    with no rebuild** — the layer `.so` sits in the app's data dir and
    `settings put global enable_gpu_debug_layers 0|1` switches it. This is how
    the root cause was found in one step; reach for it early next time.
  - **DECIDED 2026-07-23: hold the issue reply until the fix ships.** No interim
    comment. Still open before replying: cut a release carrying the fix.
  - **STILL OPEN (validation found these, neither causes the white screen):**
    40× `VUID-vkCmdDraw-renderPass-02684`, renderpass/pipeline format mismatch
    `R8G8B8A8_UNORM` vs `B8G8R8A8_UNORM` — our Android swapchain-format change
    (`rt64_application.cpp:323`) left two hardcodes behind at
    `src/ui/ui_renderer.cpp:106` and `rt64_shader_library.cpp:602` (the latter
    carries an upstream `TODO: Use whatever format the swap chain was created
    with`). The drift-proof fix is a `getFormat()` on plume's `RenderSwapChain`
    rather than a third copy of the `#ifdef`. Plus 4× `renderPass-06041`,
    `blendEnable` on an `R32G32B32A32_SFLOAT` attachment Mali cannot blend.
- **DOC BUG FOUND 2026-07-23, not yet fixed: `BUILDING.md:49`** labels
  `df8083a54296b8c151917c5333e1c85f014a2a66` as the "decompressed ROM sha1" and
  says to copy that file to the repo root as `mnsg.z64`. That hash is the
  **original 16 MiB US cart** (what the *app* validates at runtime,
  `LauncherActivity.java:36`). The repo-root build input is the **32 MiB
  decompressed** ROM, sha1 `6ea0ed71…`, which is what CI pins. Following
  BUILDING.md literally puts the wrong ROM at the repo root and fails the CI
  checksum. See memory `device-install-method`, which already warned about this
  trap.
- **Autosave is FUNCTIONALLY COMPLETE (2026-07-19).** All five steps done and
  device-verified: manual trigger, sharpened differential test, `.manual.bak`
  rollback point, save-data-settled check, and the 2-minute timer. Pushed on
  `dev`. See the Autosave section below and `docs/autosave.md`.
  - **DECIDED 2026-07-19: autosave stays Off by default. This is settled, not
    an open call** — do not re-raise it without the user. Every technical gate
    for On is met and verified; it stays Off because the feature reimplements
    Goemon's save routine, and the differential test proved the payload matches
    on the states tested, not on every state that exists. Off means anyone
    exposed to that opted in.
  - **"Defaults Off" means the WHOLE feature is off, not just the timer.**
    There is one setting, `autosave_mode` (`src/game/config.cpp:266`), and the
    early return at the top of `update_autosave` (`patches/autosave.c:605`) sits
    *above* the combo handling — so with the default in place the manual
    `L + R + Z` combo does nothing either, the settle tracking does not
    accumulate, and the Saved indicator is never seen. On a fresh install the
    feature is entirely inert until the player enables it. Earlier notes said
    "the timer defaults to Off", which wrongly implies manual saving works out
    of the box. The default applies only when the JSON key is **absent**;
    existing users keep whatever they chose.
  - **On-screen "Saved" indicator — DONE, device-verified 2026-07-19** on both
    the timed and manual paths (`src/ui/ui_saved_indicator.cpp`). The settings
    description now also states the 2-minute interval. The old claim here that
    it "needs the RT64 extended-GBI path" was **wrong**: that path has no text
    primitive, while a `recompui` context is just an RmlUi *document* and
    `set_captures_input(false)` is exactly the toast/modal switch. See
    `docs/autosave.md` § "The Saved indicator" — the mistake is the reusable
    part. Note the two hazards recorded there: the tick MUST stay above
    `draw_hook`'s launcher-return check so an expiring toast updates
    `is_any_context_shown()` before it is read (NOT a deadlock concern —
    `ui_state_mutex` is a `std::recursive_mutex` that `draw_hook` itself re-enters;
    the earlier "non-recursive → self-deadlock" note was wrong, corrected
    2026-07-20), and the guest thread may only touch an atomic.
  - Interval configurability: **DECIDED 2026-07-20 — stays a `#define`, NOT
    configurable.** The user confirmed the fixed 2-minute interval is fine; do not
    re-raise. (Settings text hardcodes "every 2 minutes", which now matches intent.)
- **Analog camera consumer fixes — DONE and DEPLOYED 2026-07-19** (`8dc748d`
  code, `80e9ace` docs, pushed to `dev`). Four fixes, all device-verified by the
  user: area-transition reset via the map id at `0x800C7AB2`; capture the
  AZIMUTH only so the game keeps control of framing distance/height (it starts
  very close on area entry and eases out over ~2s); skybox scroll in BOTH
  callers; and positional-audio pan. See the Analog camera section below and
  **`docs/re-notes/README.md`**, which is now the entry point for all RE notes.
  - **The bug CLASS to keep in mind:** the analog camera never mutates the real
    Camera — it hands a rotated private copy to specific consumers. Any consumer
    NOT hooked silently reads the UNROTATED camera and disagrees with the
    rendered view. The handled/unhandled list is in `docs/re-notes/README.md`.
  - **Storage-side rotation (one hook instead of per-consumer hooks) was
    re-litigated on 2026-07-19 and REFUTED. Do not re-open** — no hook point is
    both downstream of all producers and upstream of all consumers, and
    `func_80012878` seeds camera tweens FROM the live camera at 22 sites across
    13 overlays. Evidence in `goemon_default_cam_writer.md` §6(3).
- **SD-card game data — DONE and DEPLOYED 2026-07-19** (`d14af04`). Users can
  keep the ROM, assets, configs and saves on a removable card, chosen ONCE at
  first run. `DataPaths.java` is the single source of truth for the data dir —
  do not go back to computing it per-activity, which is how the two callers
  drifted before. Existing installs are grandfathered to internal and never
  prompted. Device-verified both ways: a fresh install landed everything on
  `/storage/<uuid>/` with internal left empty, and an existing install saw no
  prompt with save checksums unchanged.
  - **DECIDED: card pulled MID-GAME is not handled. Do not "fix" it.** Reasoning
    is in `DataPaths`' class comment. Availability is checked at launch only.
  - No migration exists by design; the first-run choice is final short of a
    reinstall. Adding migration later means copy-verify-then-delete, never move.
- **Vulkan diagnostics — DEPLOYED 2026-07-19** (`4a6552f`, via plume `65783a0`
  and rt64 `8c73b3f` — those were the fork tips THEN; **CURRENT TIPS ARE plume
  `4e77e67` / rt64 `c6ea60d`** after the 2026-07-23 issue #15 Mali fix and its
  review follow-ups (the fix itself was rt64 `3606f0b`). They were
  `c69ce04`/`3b49b22` between the pass-2 P1/S4 fix and that). Startup now logs
  the selected physical device (vendor, device API, driver version), the loader's
  Vulkan version vs what we request, and a feature line that now includes
  **`dualSrcBlend`** — added 2026-07-23 precisely because its absence was the
  issue #15 root cause and nothing in the log revealed it. Aimed at making bug
  reports from other people's hardware diagnosable without a round trip; issue
  #15 is the case study in why that matters. **All three submodule levels are pushed to their forks**
  — verify with `git ls-remote` before trusting a pointer bump, since a bump
  committed while the submodule commit stays local is unbuildable by CI.
- **Controller input rework + analog-camera zoom — DONE, DEVICE-VERIFIED, and
  SHIPPED IN v1.0.0 2026-07-20.** Committed and pushed on `main`/`dev`.
  Authored fresh from `docs/input/n64-goemon-input-assignment.csv` (the design
  doc — keep it in sync with the code).
  - **New default controller map** (`default_n64_controller_mappings`,
    `src/game/input.cpp`), Xbox face layout: A=SOUTH, B=EAST, **X=WEST→C-Up**,
    **Y=NORTH→C-Left** (X/Y swapped from the CSV's first pass per user), RB=C-Down,
    LB=**N64 L**, LT=Z, RT=R, Start, Select=menu. Right stick → C-buttons
    (suppressed→camera in analog mode). **Physical D-pad → C-buttons; N64 D-pad
    left UNBOUND** (menu nav reads the physical D-pad directly via SDL in
    `ui_state.cpp`, so menus are unaffected).
  - **`bindings_per_input` raised 2→3** (`include/recomp_input.h`) so each
    C-button holds face + right-stick + D-pad. In analog mode the stick binding
    self-suppresses, leaving face + D-pad — this is how "D-pad covers C while the
    stick drives the camera" works with no mode-swap logic.
  - **Analog-camera ZOOM** (`patches/camera.c`): hold **R (RT) + right-stick Y**
    = uniform dolly zoom (`g_analog_cam_zoom`, applied in `acam_rotate_in_place`;
    tunables `ACAM_ZOOM_RATE_PER_S` 0.9, `ACAM_ZOOM_MIN/MAX` 0.45/2.5). Stick up
    = in; resets with recenter/area-change/disengage; added to all four "engaged"
    predicates so zoom-only still reconstructs. Distance was already read live, so
    zoom is just a scale — azimuth-neutral, safe for the movement/skybox/audio
    consumers.
  - **Native N64 R suppressed while analog cam On** (`get_n64_input`,
    `controls.cpp`) so holding RT to zoom does not hijack the C-buttons into the
    game's own camera control (and native R+C zoom cannot compound). The zoom
    modifier reads the PHYSICAL trigger via the new
    `recomp_get_camera_zoom_held()` (plumbed: `recomp_api.cpp` / `main.cpp`
    REGISTER / `syms.ld` 0x8F000084 / `input.h` / `recomp_input.h` /
    `input.cpp`), so it is unaffected by the mask. R is untouched in Standard mode.
  - **Save combo moved to `L + R + Z`** and its R part now reads the physical
    trigger too, so it survives the R-mask in both modes. See the Autosave
    section.
  - **GOTCHA (will recur every default-binding change):** new defaults only apply
    to inputs ABSENT from the saved `controls.json`; existing installs keep their
    file. To pick up new defaults: in-game **Controls → Reset to Defaults**, or
    delete `controls.json` **and** `controls.json.bak` on device (both, or the
    `.bak` reloads) then relaunch. Fresh installs get the new defaults for free.
    On device the config lives at
    `/storage/<uuid>/Android/data/com.goemon64.recomp/files/data/`.
- **v1.0.2 is PUBLIC, RELEASED (Latest), and DEVICE-VERIFIED on the release
  build (2026-07-21).** Tag `v1.0.2` off `main` tip `fe6da0e`. It is the FIRST
  release carrying the pass-1 + pass-2 code-review fixes, the M2/M4 perf work
  (launcher I/O off the UI thread, recents-cold SD guard), and Attack While
  Moving incl. level-2 weapon coverage. Cut via a `v1.0.2-rc1` dry-run first
  (proved versionCode `10002`, monotonic over v1.0.1's `10001`); the rc was
  smoke-tested release-signed on the RP5 (first-run ROM flow + gameplay), then
  the rc prerelease + tag were deleted. Release notes were hand-authored and
  applied with `gh release edit --notes-file` (the workflow's `--generate-notes`
  would otherwise overwrite them). v1.0.0 and v1.0.1 remain live but shipped
  WITHOUT any pass-1/pass-2 fixes. Monitor the GitHub **issue tracker** for
  device-specific bug reports (Vulkan/driver issues on non-Adreno GPUs are the
  likely class) and triage; otherwise back to general bug-fixing. Test via the CI
  debug APK, or cut a new signed release by pushing a `v*` tag (see release setup
  below). **2026-07-22: `main` fast-forwarded to the `dev` tip `64269bd`**
  (`fe6da0e..64269bd`) — main carries the whole 2026-07-21 remediation tail
  plus the CI ROM-fetch hardening. **2026-07-23: `main` is now 4 commits BEHIND
  `dev` again** (from `64269bd`, a clean fast-forward) and does NOT yet carry
  the issue #15 Mali fix — see NEXT ACTIONS at the top of "Current focus".
  `v1.0.3` should ship the tail + the CI hardening + the Mali fix together.
- **Code-review remediation — DONE, build+CI-verified, PUSHED on `dev`
  (2026-07-20; tip `a27223a`).** A full-codebase critique (Java launcher, host
  `src/`, `patches/`, CI) fixed the high tier (H1–H7) and the long tail (L1–L14).
  Findings record with per-item verified-vs-review status and outcomes:
  **`docs/code-review-2026-07-20.md`** (cite it, don't re-derive). Things that
  change how the codebase works:
  - **New CI guard** (`patches/Makefile`): fails the patch link if any *undefined*
    `recomp_*` symbol exists — catches a host export referenced in patch C but
    missing from `syms.ld`, which `--unresolved-symbols=ignore-all` otherwise
    links as address 0 → wrong host fn at runtime. Game/libultra symbols stay
    undefined by design and are NOT flagged. Needs `llvm-nm` (both workflows
    `apt-get install llvm`). Soft spot, not hardened: if `llvm-nm` ever goes
    missing the guard passes vacuously (`command -v` preflight is the fix if wanted).
  - **Launcher `version_string` is now build-wired** (H6): gradle `vName`
    (v-stripped) → `-DGOEMON_VERSION_STRING` → CMake define → `main.cpp` macro,
    `1.0.0-dev` fallback for local host builds. No more hardcoded `0.2.0-dev`.
  - **Controller-map race + handle leak + UAF fixed** (`src/game/input.cpp`): all
    four SDL-thread writers take `cur_controllers_mutex`; disconnect closes the
    handle AND purges the freed pointer from `cur_controllers` before the close.
  - **`onDestroy` no longer kills the app on an accessibility font/display-size
    change** (`fontScale|density` added to `configChanges`; `halt(0)` guarded by
    `isFinishing()`).
  - **attack_move resets its frozen direction on area transition** (map-id
    `0x800C7AB2` guard mirroring camera.c) — first post-transition attack no
    longer lunges the previous area's heading.
  - **Analog-cam pointer swap hardened** (L9): both swap sites OR the original
    word's flag bits into the replacement (`| (old_cam & ~0x8FFFFFFEu)`) so the
    node word is bit-faithful DURING the swap window, not just after the restore.
    An initial strike of this finding was WRONG and was reopened — the lesson is
    in memory `review-findings-need-verification`.
  - **`ui_state_mutex` is `std::recursive_mutex`** (draw_hook re-enters it at
    `:738`); the old "non-recursive → self-deadlock" note (here and in comments)
    was FALSE and corrected here, in the source comments, and in the autosave §
    note. The tick runs before the launcher check for a visibility-ordering
    reason, not deadlock.
  - Device-verified: latest debug build `install -r`'d onto the RP5 (2026-07-20),
    saves intact (backed up + checksummed first — see [[device-install-method]]).
  - **M-tier backlog CLEARED (updated 2026-07-22):** M2/M4 shipped in v1.0.2;
    M6, M7, M9, M10 fixed in the 2026-07-21 tail session (see the tail bullet
    below); **M8 remains deferred** (device-gated, do together with pass-2 N5).
    L12 (annotated commented-out reference blocks) is intentional/not-actionable;
    L8 (versionCode) is done — see release section.
- **Code-review SECOND PASS remediation — DONE, build+CI-verified, PUSHED on
  `dev` (2026-07-21; parent tip `9518e2c`).** The pass-2 gap hunt
  (`docs/code-review-2026-07-20-pass2.md`) found HIGH crash bugs that shipped in
  BOTH v1.0.0 and v1.0.1. Fixed all five HIGH + two integrity + three CI items;
  each fixed row in that doc ends with a verified `→ FIXED` note (cite it, don't
  re-derive). Submodule fork tips **as of this pass** (historical — both were
  superseded on 2026-07-23 by plume `4e77e67` / rt64 `c6ea60d` for the Mali fix):
  plume `c69ce04`, rt64 `3b49b22`, both pushed to their `goemon-android` forks.
  `git ls-remote`-verified the whole gitlink chain is CI-buildable. (**N64MR was `b6f6253` here but was
  bumped to `920d493` by the 2026-07-21 tail session** — see that bullet; plume/rt64
  unchanged since.)
  What changed how the codebase works:
  - **P1/S4 — resume-window use-after-free (the fix that most matters).** The
    Android background→resume path could deref a freed `ANativeWindow` (host
    published it with no `ANativeWindow_acquire`; plume's `recreateSurface`
    failure path left `desc.renderWindow` at a window `vkDestroySurfaceKHR` just
    un-refed). Fixed with ONE **ownership invariant**: every window in a slot
    (`g_pending_resume_window` → plume `pendingRenderWindow` → `desc.renderWindow`)
    carries exactly one owned ref; balanced acquire/release at each transfer; the
    swap-chain ctor acquires the construction window; `recreateSurface` adopts the
    new window BEFORE surface teardown so the failure path is deref-safe. Spans
    `src/main/rt64_render_context.cpp` + plume. See [[anativewindow-ownership-model]].
    **DEVICE-VERIFIED 2026-07-21** on the RP5 via an automated lock/unlock stress
    harness (30 slow + rapid cycles): 33 surface recreations across 5 distinct
    ANativeWindow ptrs, pid constant, ZERO SIGSEGV/tombstone, saves byte-identical,
    game renders fine after (screenshot-confirmed). The `[plume] surface recreated`
    line is the fix executing. CAVEATS: the `vkCreateAndroidSurfaceKHR`-fails branch
    was never empirically forced (surface creation succeeded every cycle) —
    correct-by-construction only; and programmatic rapid lock/unlock RACES the RP5
    keyguard, yielding transient VK_ERROR_SURFACE_LOST / NATIVE_WINDOW_IN_USE
    swapchain retries — absorbed safely (NOT crashes, NOT recreateSurface fails; a
    real human unlock is clean). Harness: `docs/testing/resume-stress.sh`.
  - **S1** — Android `SDL_QUIT` (from `onDestroy`, which then blocks the UI
    thread) now quits immediately instead of opening an un-answerable prompt that
    wedged the app until SIGKILL (`input.cpp`). Prompt kept desktop-only.
  - **N1** — the four `load_*_config` bodies catch `nlohmann::json::exception`, so
    a parseable-but-wrong-typed config resets to defaults instead of
    `std::terminate`-ing pre-window (crash loop). `config.cpp`.
  - **N2** — binding-scan cancel deferred off the SDL event thread (atomic
    `request_cancel_scanning_input` / `poll_scan_cancel_requested`, drained in
    `draw_hook` before `Context::Update()`), so it no longer races the render
    thread's RmlUi `DirtyVariable` (was heap corruption).
  - **N3** — the five On/Off enums that default Off now list **Off first** in
    their `NLOHMANN_JSON_SERIALIZE_ENUM` map, so a corrupt/unknown value fails to
    the default rather than silently enabling autosave/cheats/analog-cam.
    `BackgroundInputMode` stays On-first ON PURPOSE (its default IS On) — the rule
    is "fallback = the setting's own default." `goemon_config.h` / `recomp_input.h`.
  - **N4** — all nine numeric setters (`ui_config.cpp`) clamp to `[0,100]`; the
    deadzone==100 divide-by-zero is also guarded in `apply_joystick_deadzone`.
    Kills NaN stick / rumble overflow / 100× volume from hand-edited config.
  - **C1/C2/C3 (CI)** — `android.yml` gets `permissions: contents: read`; both
    workflows validate the committed `gradle-wrapper.jar` via a SHA-pinned
    `gradle/actions/wrapper-validation@ed408507` and `gradle-wrapper.properties`
    pins `distributionSha256Sum` for gradle-8.0; `android-release.yml` rejects a
    `v*` tag whose commit isn't an ancestor of `main`.
  - **DEVICE-VERIFIED 2026-07-21 (RP5), automated via adb** — besides P1/S4
    (above): N1 (wrong-typed `general.json` → clean launch + reset to defaults, no
    crash-loop), N3 (garbage enum strings → Analog Camera / Autosave show **Off**
    in the Settings UI, not On), N4 (deadzone 500 → 100%, rumble −80 → 0% clamped,
    no NaN). Original config restored + checksum-verified after. Config-robustness
    harness approach: force-stop → adb push a crafted JSON to the SD data dir →
    relaunch → screenshot the Settings UI.
  - **MANUAL checks ALL PASSED on device 2026-07-21** (user-driven, RP5): S1
    (recents swipe-away in-game → prompt clean exit, no wedge), N2 (rapid
    cancel/rebind → no crash; dropbox shows NO native tombstone today), S4 (rapid
    app-switch via Recents → resumes clean, pid constant), and general gameplay
    (movement/attacks/char-swap/analog-cam+zoom/save combo — no regressions).
    **So the entire pass-2 fix set is now device-verified.** Verifying a native
    crash's ABSENCE: `adb shell dumpsys dropbox` is authoritative (a SIGSEGV/abort
    leaves a `data_app_native_crash`) — more reliable than a live logcat grep.
  - **v1.0.0 AND v1.0.1 shipped from `main` with NONE of pass-1's or pass-2's
    fixes; `v1.0.2` (released 2026-07-21) is the first to carry all of them** —
    see the release-state bullet near the top.
- **Pass-2 MED/LOW tail + pass-1 M-tier backlog — DONE 2026-07-21 (with
  deferrals), build-green, PUSHED on `dev`; promoted to `main` 2026-07-22.**
  Seven batches: `7330bd3` (S3-host/M7/M9/N10/N16), `ca21489` (M6/M10),
  `1fbbb30` (B1–B4), `c487b13` (S3 submodule bump), `1db4d63` (S2), `dab5be7`
  (N6–N9/N11–N15), `5f04fec` (C4–C6/D1–D5/R1/R2-status). Full per-finding
  record: **`docs/code-review-2026-07-21-remediation.md`** (cite it, don't
  re-derive). **N64ModernRuntime gitlink bumped `b6f6253` → `920d493`**
  (fork-pushed, ls-remote-verified; plume/rt64 tips unchanged at
  `c69ce04`/`3b49b22`; **plume/rt64 have since moved to `4e77e67`/`c6ea60d` for
  the Mali fix**). Was held from device testing at the maintainer's request; a
  checksum-verified save backup was taken first
  (`goemon-backups/2026-07-21-preinstall-debug/`).
  **PARTIALLY discharged 2026-07-23:** the RP5 now runs a debug build of the
  `dev` tip, which contains this whole tail, and a short gameplay session off
  the maintainer's own save rendered and played correctly. That is a **smoke
  test only** — it exercised boot, save load, movement and rendering, NOT the
  specific per-finding behaviours the tail changed. Treat the tail as
  smoke-tested, not verified. Still open from both passes:
  **M8 + N5** (device-gated engine-detection / R-mask-scope checks, coupled —
  do together), S2 + N13 device checks, **P-tier perf (P2–P7) not started**,
  R2 (maintainer keep-or-kill on desktop scaffolding), and the Dependabot npm
  PRs (build-tooling only).
- **Attack While Moving — DONE, device-verified, deployment hold RELEASED
  2026-07-21 (user's call).** Base feature `9bae463`; the level-2 (upgraded)
  weapon coverage is a follow-up commit on `dev`. A
  novelty setting `attack_while_moving_mode` (default **Off**) that lets the
  player keep moving during a ground attack instead of rooting in place. Wired
  end-to-end like the "Swap While Moving" toggle (config+JSON, `ui_config.cpp`,
  `recomp_api` export `recomp_get_attack_while_moving_enabled` @ `0x8F000088`,
  settings row + D-pad nav in `general.rml`). Feature lives in
  `patches/attack_move.{c,h}`; inert when Off.
  - **How it works:** the game zeroes the player's velocity for the WHOLE attack
    (device-probed across 900+ frames — the attack action handlers never run the
    movement integrator), so movement is *re-injected* by writing a per-frame
    displacement onto the authoritative head position node `*(0x801FC60C)+0x8/10`.
    Direction is **sampled from the game's own world motion during real
    locomotion and frozen for the swing** — reconstructing it from the camera
    basis MOONWALKED (the azimuth disagreed with the character's facing, and no
    sign flip fixed it; it was also a feedback loop when sampled during the
    attack). An ease envelope ramps it in/out; a short post-attack HOLD cancels
    the game's recovery re-anchor (the residual "slide back to origin" the user
    saw). Movement is NOT collision-checked during the swing (inferred, not
    verified — do not claim wall-clipping as fact; the wall-clip line was cut
    from the UI copy for exactly that reason).
  - **Covered action states (device-identified via the `[astate]` action_id
    logger in `attack_move.c`, gated by `ATTACK_MOVE_STATE_DIAG`, left in the
    file behind its `#if` for future discovery):**
    - LEVEL 1: melee/jump family `0x58`–`0x5E`, ryo throw `0x7C`, bombs `0x90`.
    - LEVEL 2 (upgraded weapon, added 2026-07-21): melee combo `0x60`–`0x65`
      (observed cycling `0x60/0x61/0x62/0x65` on ALL four characters; `0x63/0x64`
      first inferred, then OBSERVED on the verify pass — real swing frames);
      Goemon coin-throw variant `0x7F`; character specials `0x82`–`0x89`
      (Goemon `0x82/0x83`, Ebisumaru `0x84/0x85/0x86/0x89`; `0x87/0x88` inferred);
      Sasuke special `0x93`–`0x94`. All read `vel==0` (rooted), same as L1.
    - **Yae's (char 3) L2 special was NOT captured** — she only did the `0x60`
      combo. If one exists it stays rooted; flip the logger back on to catch it.
    - The specials are inference-plus-feel-check, not per-id device-confirmed.
    - **Hookshot/extension `0x70`–`0x72` deliberately EXCLUDED** — it anchors the
    pipe to a world point; sliding during it risks desyncing the grapple (ladder
    hazard class). `0xBA` (swap-in-progress) also excluded. Extends the
    char-swap RE `action_id` map.
  - **Gotcha reused:** the RML change needs the device's `.assets_version` stamp
    deleted or the old UI stays extracted. Node-chain writes crash the renderer
    (a pointer field at `+0x8`) — only the proven vec3f head node is safe to poke.
- **PARKED — do not start without the user's say-so:**
  - **World→screen projector fix** (`func_8001CB40` / `func_8001CC38_1D838`) —
    parked 2026-07-19. Mechanism is confirmed wrong (screen-space overlays are
    positioned from the unrotated camera) but nothing player-visible has been
    observed routing through it, and the fix means reproducing ~65 instructions
    of dense float math where a transcription slip would misplace everything
    silently. UNPARK TRIGGER: a 2D effect seen sitting beside rather than on
    whatever produced it, after orbiting. Full detail + the `+0x1A` fov-vs-roll
    resolution in `docs/re-notes/README.md`.
- **Sibling repo: Quest64-Recomp** (`~/projects/Quest64-Recomp`) — UNPARKED, now
  an ACTIVE sibling project with its own working context (see its CLAUDE.md; don't
  duplicate its state here). Its CI was modeled on Goemon's, so **CI/security
  fixes found in either repo should be checked against the other** — 2026-07-22:
  Quest's ROM-fetch hardening (`7bd6068`, post-audit) was ported here as
  `64269bd`.

## Public repo + release process (DONE 2026-07-20)
- **PII REGRESSION 2026-07-23 — scrubbed on `dev`, but NOT yet purged from
  GitHub. Open item.** `docs/re-notes/RESUME-mali-issue15.md` (added by the
  pre-rewrite commit `cb1cf87`) carried the Windows account name in two paths and
  the A15's hardware **serial** into the public repo. No credentials. `main` never
  carried the file. Fixed forward, then `dev` history was rewritten with
  `git filter-branch` over `cb1cf87~1..dev` and force-pushed
  (`da4eb53` → `df300ac`); all refs and every commit reachable from `dev` now scan
  clean, and `main` was untouched (the rewrite range started after it).
  **THE LESSON, which cost a false sense of completion: a history rewrite plus
  force-push does NOT remove anything from GitHub.** The orphaned commits still
  resolve — verified, not assumed:
  `gh api repos/ogdanimal/Goemon64Recomp-Android/contents/<path>?ref=<old-sha>
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.raw"` still returns the leaked lines. The
  old SHAs were discoverable from the Actions run history, so this was not
  security-by-obscurity-that-works.
  **CLOSED 2026-07-23 by deleting the discovery path, not by purging.** All 79
  workflow runs were matched against the exact 15-commit leaked set (derived from
  the backup branch, NOT from a live orphan check — an earlier orphan check
  silently mislabelled three unrelated runs and would have destroyed them); the
  5 runs that published leaked-range SHAs were deleted, and the anonymous
  discovery chain was re-run and returns nothing. Live surfaces — issues, all
  comments, releases, tags — scanned clean.
  **DECIDED: no GitHub Support request.** The objects survive on GitHub and are
  still retrievable by anyone who *already* recorded a pre-rewrite SHA (an old
  clone, a mirror, the archived events stream), but nothing in the repo hands out
  the key any more. It is a surname, not a credential, so there is nothing to
  rotate. Do not re-raise this without new evidence.
  Backups of the pre-rewrite history: local branch `backup/pre-scrub-rewrite`,
  `refs/original/refs/heads/dev`, and a verified bundle at
  `%USERPROFILE%\goemon-backups\2026-07-23-pre-history-rewrite\`.
  **Every doc that cited a pre-rewrite `dev` hash is now citing a dead commit** —
  this is exactly why `RESUME-mali-review.md` says to read the tip rather than
  trust a written hash.
- **Repo is PUBLIC.** The `validate-external` fork-PR gate turned out UNNEEDED —
  neither workflow triggers on `pull_request`, so fork PRs can't run CI or reach
  the ROM secret. Before flipping, the whole repo + history + submodules + APK were
  scrubbed of PII (local usernames, device labels, the maintainer's name) and
  secret-scanned (gitleaks, 0 real findings). Builds also strip absolute source
  paths via `-ffile-prefix-map` (top of `CMakeLists.txt`), so no compiled binary
  (local debug or CI release) embeds the builder's home dir / username. GitHub hardening enabled: **secret scanning, push protection,
  Dependabot** (Dependabot has opened PRs for `assets/scss` build-tooling npm
  deps — build-time only, not shipped in the APK).
- **Releases are tag-triggered + signed** via `.github/workflows/android-release.yml`:
  push a `v*` tag → recompile → signed `assembleRelease` → publishes a GitHub
  Release with the APK. `versionName` = the tag (`v1.0.0` → 1.0.0). `versionCode`
  is **tag-derived semver** `major*10000+minor*100+patch` (changed 2026-07-20,
  was `git rev-list --count` which drifts on a history rewrite — this repo has
  scrubbed history once; `build.gradle` reads `-PvName`/`-PvCode`). The release
  workflow now also REJECTS a tag that isn't `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-suffix]` or has
  minor/patch ≥ 100; `-rc` tags intentionally share their final release's code.
  v1.0.0 shipped code 661 (old scheme); any release ≥ v1.0.1 → ≥ 10001, so the
  switch is monotonic (v1.0.1 → 10001, v1.0.2 → 10002). **v1.0.0, v1.0.1, and
  v1.0.2 are released** (all from `main`; v1.0.2 released 2026-07-21 is Latest and
  the first with the pass-1/pass-2 fixes — see the code-review bullets). The next
  cut is `v1.0.3` off `dev`; do a `vX.Y.Z-rc1` dry-run tag first to prove the
  versionCode derivation end-to-end before the real cut. RELEASE-NOTES GOTCHA: the
  workflow publishes with `gh release create --generate-notes`, which OVERWRITES
  any body — hand-authored notes must be applied AFTER with
  `gh release edit <tag> --notes-file <file>` (done for v1.0.2). Keep notes
  emoji-free (user preference, 2026-07-21).
  Repo secrets: `RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD`,
  `RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS` (`goemon-upload`), `RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD` (+ the existing
  `G64RS_REPO_WITH_PAT` ROM secret).
- **Signing keystore = ONE-WAY DOOR.** PKCS12, backed up + checksum-verified at
  `%USERPROFILE%\goemon-backups\keystore-2026-07-20\goemon-release.jks`. Signing
  cert **SHA-256 `47323a0b…`** — every legitimate update MUST be signed with this
  same key/cert or it won't install over an existing install. `.gitignore` ignores
  `keystore.properties`/`*.jks`/`*.keystore`.
- To cut an update: bump nothing manually — just `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin
  vX.Y.Z` on a clean tip. Do a `v*-rc*` tag first to dry-run the pipeline if unsure.

## Autosave (COMPLETE — all 5 steps device-verified, pushed on dev)
Resume prompt for a fresh session: `docs/re-notes/RESUME-autosave.md`.
Feature doc: `docs/autosave.md`. RE: `docs/re-notes/goemon_save_re.md`.
Evidence corpus (cite it, don't re-derive): `docs/re-notes/fixtures/`.

Commits on `dev`: `70d3e4d` feature, `9522fe8` docs+RE corrections,
`49fedf8` `.bak` hazard reframing, `71e56a5` fixtures.

WHAT WORKS: manual trigger `L + R + Z` (was `L + R + D-Pad Up`; changed 2026-07-20
when the reworked controller map bound the physical D-pad to the C-buttons,
making N64 D-Up unproducible — Z is the third harmless input alongside L and R).
Edge-triggered. The single `autosave_mode` setting defaults **Off**, which
disables this combo too — see the note above.
- **Analog-camera zoom interaction (RESOLVED 2026-07-20):** analog-camera zoom
  uses R (right trigger) as its modifier, so `get_n64_input` masks N64 R out of
  the button word while Analog Camera mode is On. The `L+R+Z` combo therefore
  reads its **R part from the physical trigger** (`recomp_get_camera_zoom_held`),
  so it works identically in both modes; L and Z stay in the N64 button word. See
  docs/autosave.md.
Commits through Goemon's own save data/slot format by reimplementing
`func_80214D58_5D0228` (overlay code, so not callable). Writes the slot the
player loaded — which is the game's *native* semantic, since an in-game save
offers no slot choice either. Verified on device: `status 0`, correct slot
including a non-zero one, and the differential test PASSED (payload
byte-identical to the game's own routine apart from CRC + a play-time byte).
`SAVE_SLOT_COUNT = 3` confirmed.

TWO REMAINING (in `RESUME-autosave.md`):
1. Sharpen the differential test — the passing one compared near-identical
   state ("equal when nothing changed"). Change hearts `+0x6C` / ryo `+0x74` /
   stage `+0x200` first, then autosave + NPC-save and confirm both moved
   identically. Compare `cmp -i 256` — a whole-file `cmp` is a FALSE FAILURE.
2. Rollback mechanism — **DONE, VERIFIED ON DEVICE 2026-07-19.** `.manual.bak`
   matched the manual save and survived two autosaves 4.6s apart (the original
   loss scenario) while `.bak` became an autosave. The timer's gating
   precondition is MET. Design changed
   late: **observe guest pak writes host-side**, no game function patched. The
   earlier "notify via `RECOMP_PATCH func_8000B718_C318`" plan is **SUPERSEDED —
   do not implement it** (no `RECOMP_HOOK` in this toolchain, so `RECOMP_PATCH`
   replaces the whole function). Two generic hooks in the `lib/N64ModernRuntime`
   submodule + all policy in `src/game/save_rollback.cpp`. (An earlier note here
   said the submodule commit was **not yet pushed to `fork`** so CI could not
   build the pointer bump — **STALE, corrected 2026-07-19**: the recorded pointer
   `b6f6253` matches the `ogdanimal/N64ModernRuntime` `goemon-android` tip, and
   CI is green.) Killed two old
   worries: the active-disarm rule (suspends never reach the pak) and the
   fixtures byte-identity precondition (now vacuous). Pak diagnostics
   reachability: **RESOLVED, UNREACHABLE, HIGH confidence.**
3. Save-data-settled check — **DONE, VERIFIED ON DEVICE 2026-07-19.** Watches 4
   ranges across the live block `0x8015C5D8` AND gamedata (gamedata alone is
   stale for HP/ryo/lives — only the marshal writes `gd+0x64`). GOTCHA: the
   first passing run proved nothing, since an inert check would look identical;
   two provoked positive controls were needed. See `docs/autosave.md` § "The
   settled check" before changing the watched ranges.
4. **The timer — DONE, VERIFIED ON DEVICE 2026-07-19.** 2-min interval; saves
   only when safe + settled + something actually changed (walking changes
   nothing watched, so idle/walking produces no writes). Full cycle observed.
   Ships **Off** by default along with the rest of the feature — DECIDED
   2026-07-19, settled, see the note near the top of this file.

RULE THIS FEATURE EARNED THE HARD WAY (3 separate occasions): for anything that
refuses or declines, build the diagnostic that proves it is REACHING ITS
DECISION POINT. Silence looked like success in the differential test (header
residue), the settled check (would have been inert), and the timer (looked
dead). A passing test with no such diagnostic proves nothing.

GOTCHAS THAT COST TIME (all documented, repeated here because they bite):
- `0x800C7A9E` is a 3-phase init/run/exit counter, gameplay == **1** not 0. The
  old note had it inverted and it refused every save.
- The gate's `andi 0x1000` reads a BUTTON word; `0x1000` is `CONT_START`. It is
  a trigger, not a safety guard. Do not add it as a guard.
- Step 10 (`func_80023698_24298`) writes `0x100` bytes and leaks `0xF0` bytes of
  uninitialised stack into the file. Two saves of identical state ALWAYS differ
  there. Nothing reads past `0x0F`; it is not a bug.
- `.bak` is NOT a recovery copy once autosave is enabled — `files.cpp:39-45`
  rotates on every flush, and every autosave is a flush. True of the *current*
  build, not just a future timer. `.manual.bak` is the deliberate rollback point
  and is device-verified (survives autosaves); `.bak` is still autosave data.
- `sub 3` in an autosave refusal is NOT dialogue — standing in an inn reads
  `sub 3` too, with `busy 0`. Dialogue additionally sets `busy` non-zero. The
  gate is faithful: the game's own pause menu also refuses in that inn spot, so
  autosave does not fire in inns.
- `make -C patches` needs `CC=clang LD=ld.lld`; an inherited `CC=cc` defeats the
  Makefile's `CC ?= clang`. `~/goemon-build-all.sh` passes both.

## Analog camera (v14 — WORKING, committed on dev)
Full resume prompt for a fresh session: `docs/re-notes/RESUME.md`.
v14 = the two root-cause fixes that made it actually work (2026-07-18,
on-device confirmed: orbit is clean, no drift while walking):
(1) SINE CONVENTION BUG — `func_80003E10_4A10` (math_sin) returns a true
unit sine but its FULL TURN = 0x400 (1024), NOT 0x10000. camera.c had
assumed 0x10000 and added 0x4000 for cosine → that offset is 16 whole
0x400 periods, so sin==cos aliased to one table entry (matrix
non-orthonormal). The "rotation" silently RESCALED the eye radius each
frame (rOut collapsing to 0) → the camera swung INTO the player then
flipped. Proof: widescreen.c masks its arg `& 0x3FF`; back-solved s=c=0.733
= sin(1402 mod 1024). Fix: `acam_sin(a)=func_80003E10_4A10((a>>6)&0x3FF)`,
cos offset `0x100`. (This DISPROVES the old note that these trig helpers
take 0x10000-unit angles.)
(2) ABSOLUTE-OVERRIDE (Zelda64Recomp `update_analog_camera_params` model)
— rotating the LIVE camera inherited Goemon's follow-cam, which swings its
own azimuth behind movement, so the view drifted back while walking. Now:
on the first engaged frame, snapshot the eye→look_at offset
(`g_acam_captured` + `g_acam_off_{x,y,z}`), then each frame rotate THAT held
offset by accumulated yaw/pitch and re-anchor to the LIVE look_at (which
still tracks the player). Overrides the game azimuth → no drift; look_at is
now the pitch/orbit pivot (was the player node). Capture resets on leaving
gameplay so re-engaging never jumps. The `func_801CE3F0` basis swap now
also triggers on `g_acam_captured` so walking stays view-relative.
TRADEOFF (by design): once engaged, the game's auto-follow is overridden
for the rest of the area (no auto-return-to-behind-you). Optional slow
drift-back is a possible follow-up.
Zelda ref confirmed helpful: their `update_analog_cam` accumulates spherical
yaw/pitch, `update_analog_camera_params` re-syncs from the live camera when
idle (`Math_Atan2S(eye−at)`) and rebuilds eye via `OLib_AddVecGeoToVec3f`
(= at + geo(r,pitch,yaw)); `camera_transform_tagging.c` is frame-interp
tagging (orthogonal, not used).
DONE since: menu settings added (per-axis invert via the pre-existing
`CameraInvertMode` plumbing; Camera Sensitivity X/Y, 0-100 with 50 = the tuned
base rate; R3 = drop the override so the game's follow-cam resumes), the
dependent rows grey out + focus-disable while Analog Camera is Off
(`data-attrif-disabled`, NOT `data-attr-` — the latter sets the attribute even
when false), and the dense [acamR]/[acamU]/[acamB]/[acamH] diagnostics are
STRIPPED. Committed on dev as 83daa6a.
ZOOM — DONE, device-verified, and SHIPPED IN v1.0.0 2026-07-20 (hold R/RT +
right-stick Y; see the input-rework bullet in "Current focus"). FEEL/POLISH:
**DECIDED 2026-07-20 — good as-is, do not tune proactively.** The user confirmed
the rates, clamps, pitch-sign, and the Y-invert↔zoom coupling all feel right;
revisit only if players actually complain. Build = one call:
`wsl -d Ubuntu bash ~/goemon-build-all.sh`.
GOTCHA: after any `assets/` change, delete the device's
`files/data/.assets_version` stamp or the app keeps the OLD extracted UI.

v13 fixes the v12 footage artifacts: (1) horizon roll — the view builder
func_80017D8C reads a ROLL binang halfword from Camera+0x18 (unknown_18)
and builds guLookAtHilite's up = (sin r, cos r, 0); a game-set roll is only
valid for the original azimuth, so the rotated copy now zeroes +0x18;
(2) extreme pitch — absolute radius-preserving eye-elevation clamp
[−10°, +55°] on top of the game's base angle (near-vertical views made the
fixed up-vector degenerate). [acamP] now prints pitch too.
ARCHITECTURE CLOSED (goemon_default_cam_writer.md): there is NO per-frame
default camera writer — default Camera = static BSS 0x8020CBF0, poses set
only on zone-trigger cuts (set-active-camera choke point func_8001C3E0;
& 0x8FFFFFFE = uncached→cached ptr mask; dead-code player-follow snapper
func_801F8FD0 exists but is never called). So consumer-side hooks are the
CORRECT final architecture, not a workaround.
- CORRECTION 2026-07-19: 0x801684A0/0x801684F0 were listed here as "active
  globals". They are NOT camera state — they are func_80016C44's per-object
  animation/skeleton scratch, reassigned for every drawn object every frame
  (patches/anime.c:50,108 already decompiles them that way). Useless as a
  camera-cut signal. For area transitions use the map id at 0x800C7AB2.
- RE-LITIGATED AND RE-CLOSED 2026-07-19: rotating the real camera in place
  (one hook instead of per-consumer hooks) was investigated properly and is
  REFUTED. (a) No hook point is simultaneously downstream of all camera
  producers and upstream of all consumers — they interleave inside the same
  object walk. (b) func_80012878 seeds camera tweens FROM the live camera at
  22 sites across 13 overlays, so a rotated struct would make every scripted
  camera move ease from the player's orbit pose. DO NOT re-open; details and
  the consumer/handled list are in docs/re-notes/README.md.
- READ docs/re-notes/README.md BEFORE trusting any goemon_*.md: it carries
  standing methodology warnings (jal-only scans produce false negatives;
  validate a scan pattern against a known positive before trusting a zero;
  identify struct fields by how their trig is consumed) plus the corrections
  those warnings triggered.
v12 = v11 + feel/pitch: TIME-BASED rates via recomp_time_us (yaw 0x5800
binang/s, pitch 0x2C00/s, quadratic response curve, 50ms dt clamp — fixes
the call-rate-dependent touchiness of the old per-call 0x200), plus pitch:
eye swings vertically about the player pivot in the (dist,height) plane,
look_at fixed, clamp +0x2C00/−0x1400, eye-azimuth (and so the movement
basis azimuth) untouched; basis swap covers pitch too. Pitch sign: stick
up = positive input_y = eye rises (flip the sign on `curved` in
update_analog_camera if the user wants inverted).
Basis-verify agent CONFIRMED: basis is movement's ONLY camera input,
rotation is 1:1 (goemon_basis_verify.md).
Right-stick analog camera via render-side rotation. v10 = v9 + player-pos
orbit pivot ([acamP] CONFIRMED live: pos tracks the player incl. height).
v11 = v10 + native movement basis: RECOMP_PATCH of func_801CE3F0_58A300
(faithful C reproduction in patches/camera.c) swaps the camera node's
Camera pointer (*(node+0x2C), node=*(objA+0x18)) to a yaw-rotated copy
around the func_801CE4D0 call, so the resolver's basis matches the rendered
view; the host left-stick counter-rotation is OFF (recomp_set_analog_cam_yaw(0)).
(The old "slow camera spiral / drift while walking" watch-item is RESOLVED by
the v14 absolute-override above — the follow-cam no longer bleeds in.)

### RE findings (2026-07-17 static-RE sweep, critic-verified; reports in
### the session scratchpad goemon_*.md — copy them somewhere durable!)
- PLAYER POSITION (static proof, triple convergence): pos node =
  *(u32*)0x801FC60C (spawn-time cache of player->0x18; player object =
  *(u32*)0x801FC604, both written once in func_801CB5D0_5874E0). World pos
  f32 x/y/z at node+0x8/0xC/0x10; integrator func_801CC4C0_5883D0 adds
  velocity onto exactly these offsets. Heading binang = *(u16*)0x8020C904.
  Engine-wide rule: object world transform is behind *(obj+0x18)
  (pos +0x8/C/10, rot u16 +0x14/16/18).
- INVERSION ROOT CAUSE (proven): movement resolver func_801CE4D0_58A3E0
  (sole pose→basis converter; single caller chain func_801CD310→
  func_801CE3F0) builds its basis from the LIVE render Camera struct:
  eye−look_at read via *(*(*(player+0x64)+0x18)+0x2C) & 0x8FFFFFFE. v9/v10
  rotate a private copy, so the resolver sees the unrotated camera. Complete
  fix = rotate the eye−at delta by the analog yaw inside func_801CE4D0
  (built at 0x801CE514-44 into sp+0x4C/50/54, before normalize @0x801CE558)
  and DROP the host counter-rotation hack. Do NOT rotate the stick record.
- *(u32*)0x8020CA2C is NOT a movement object: it is re-pointed every tick by
  func_801CC4C0 at a static 0x18-byte processed-STICK record
  (0x800C7DB0 + 24*idx): +0xC magnitude, +0x10/+0x14 planar components.
  Still valid as the in-gameplay gate.
- func_0800037C_72E5DC is a scripted EARTHQUAKE-CUTSCENE camera (overlay
  rombase 0x72E260, one sibling func_08000B54_72EDB4, no per-area copies).
  Camera tween module 0x80012304..0x80012940: func_80012900 commits a
  0x60-byte image from *(handle+0x6C) onto the Camera via an INTEGER copy
  loop (swc1 scans are blind to this pattern). No shared base-exe eye/at
  helper exists; scripted overlays inline their camera writes (~6 large +
  ~10 partial across ~12 overlays).
- Default-area follow-cam writer still UNFOUND (last gap). Leads: template
  0x8020CBF0 members (callback 0x801D23C8 is a no-op stub), callers of
  func_80012900/func_80012878, vram gap 0x800126E0-0x80012810, integer-copy
  loops aliasing *(0x801FC628)+0x2C. 0x801FC628 = camera view node
  (*(objA+0x18), objA=*(0x801FC624)); its +0x2C holds the render Camera ptr.
- *(0x8015CD60) is a per-area-repurposed static param block (3 readers in
  the whole binary; movement resolver does NOT read it) — wrong lever.

NEXT: (1) confirm [acamP] pos tracks the player on device → pivot fix
validated; (2) patch func_801CE4D0 (reimplement in patches/, rotating the
eye−at delta) and remove the host counter-rotation → kills the inversion
quirk; (3) optional: find the default cam writer for a true native orbit.
